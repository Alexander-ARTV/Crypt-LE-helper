# Lines starting with @ denotes file types to transfer,
# file endings will be appended to the current certificate name 
# by the script to specify which files to transfer.
#
# Lines containing a connection string will be used as a target
# for the files constructed from the last file type specification.
#
# Lines starting with & are commands that will be ran,
# typically to further load the certificates on targets or reload specific services.
#
# Make sure to setup and share SSH identities to be able to use unattended distribution.
